# Google Political Ads
Google supports responsible political advertising in the United States through several steps, but the most important of these is transparency into who is purchasing ads through our advertising platform. You can learn more about the [Political Ads Transparency Report](https://adstransparency.google.com/political?political&region=US) by visiting their website or start analyzing the data in BigQuery through the [BigQuery Public Datasets Program](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/transparency-report/google-political-ads).
